        <H2>WHAT IS IT?</H2>
          <p>
            Have you ever wondered what happens to the information you put online? Who sees it, or even where it goes once itâ€™s online? Guise is a concept that caters to the curious who ask themselves these question. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Guise aims to promote web transparency and empower the users. Unlike other applications or browser plug-ins that simply alert the user to trackers and block them from tracking, Guise gives the user the power to not only see who is tracking them (an option available elsewhere) but also see what information the trackers are taking and what they are doing with this information. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A key part of this concept is creating an easy way for the consumer to acknowledge the darker side of the web, and web services common society take for granted. The side that takes the information uploaded and uses it for analytic purposes and other services. 
          </p>

          <p>
            This application highlights the willingness of consumers to publish information about themselves online without a second thought and the potential consequences or benefits of this. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Guise is an unbiased service that displays information clearly for the consumer, so they can view how their online behaviours can effect their online experience (e.g. targeted ads) and how this effects their privacy. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The precedents that helped to influence the development of this concept include two popular anti-tracking browser plug-ins currently available for free, Ghostery and Do Not Track Plus. However, these two precedents focus on blocking trackers (one slightly more hands-on than the other in approach but both being competitors for the same market). 
          </p>

          <p>
            These two precedents achieve one part of the Guise aim successfully, but are still limited when it comes to allowing the consumer to see what information is being tracked, and for what purpose. This is where Guise aims to take one step further and help to educate and inform the consumer in a non-invasive manor.
