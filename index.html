          <p>
            For this project moving forward proved to be surprisingly difficult, as the mobile application of this concept is rather difficult and daunting to approach.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through extensive research, I discovered that one of the main difficulties with the difference between applying a concept to a desktop situation versus a mobile application is the kind of operating systems and code involved. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For general desktop application, everything you need is runing through the active browser(s). This means the information is slightly easier to access and (with it all using the standard http operating system, the method for retrieving information is standard and doesn't change).
          </p>

          <p>
            For mobile application, the added difficulty includes: the requirement of permissions to access the information of internet accessing applications on the device, the varying ways these applications access the internet and how this may/will affect the coding of the program itself, and also how the information will get presented to the user (especially if it's a seperate application, what incouragement is there to swap between active applications to check this information is there?). Another factor that will also impact it is, will this application monitor only active applications, or even applications on the mobile device that are connected to the internet and sending/recieving information in the background (and how does this effect the development of the application this concept proposes).
          </p>
          <p>
            To help myself move forward with the development of this project, I found I got quite caught up in the  theoritical side, and how the application of this concept could be approached once I moved into the code itself (the more daunting part of this project for me considering I am not a strong coder). 
            </p>
            <p>
            My main focus of this project, was implementing code such as the jQuery cookie library (which functions like a JavaScript API). However, I was having issues and could not get the jQuery cookie library to work (this is due to the fact I didn't understand it properly). Ideally, I want to be able to notify that there's a cookie on the page, what it's called, and what it's doing. This is a challenge for me, having never before (aside from briefly for project one) having tried to work with any major coding language (I've only really worked with both html and css). Last year I also opted out of coding for the final product, so I have never used any API system either, so this was an interesting challenge to try and overcome. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <p>
            My limited time frame for this project due to outside effects also greatly halted my beginning of this project, which meant I was trying to learn things I'd never looked into with a considerable time restraint. This and my lack of knowledge of the JavaScript coding language (which proved to be slightly easier to implement than the jQuery library) were my two main challenges for this. One other issue, was for my concept it was mobile specific, but this project I developed for desktop. This was more due to the fact my understanding of code and how these all corrilate and work together is rather limited, and I needed to work on this.
            </p>
            <p>
            I wanted to build on the previous project where I'd managed to implement the creation of a cookie and show this by counting the times you viewed the page (recognised by said cookie). This was surprisingly difficult. Again, this was just due to the technical difficulties I had understanding the code, but this process helped to highlight some areas of focus that need building on -- and how hard it is to balance the theory and technical sides of the development process.
            </p>
            <p>
            Understanding how to implement cookie information in a code environment is just one step closer to developing my concept, but without the knowledge of how to do this, taking the leap to developing the concept further will become too much of a tevchnical challenege and I feel it will be too overwhelming to attempt without actually understanding at least some of the basics/grounding of these technologies. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Working on a way to pull cookie information is one I need to continue to work on, as currently I am only pulling limited information from cookies I have created locally, and not any information from any other cookies, which is almost the next step I need to take. If I can nail down how to draw information from cookies it will go a ways to helping me understand the technical side of this concept.
            </p>
            <p>
            Currently, although the system in place doesn't present this information seperately to the viewer, there are actually two seperate cookies coded being implemented. One the viewer can name on visiting the site, and one that counts how many times you've visited the site. 
            </p>
